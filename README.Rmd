This is a draft R package that provides convenience functions for the
organization, curation, and visualization of microbiome data sets. This package
is lightly maintained by a single human and is provided as is, with no
guarantees of any kind.

Please see the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) for important updates and bug fixes,
and make sure you are using the most recent version of this package. A major bug 
fix was released January 17, 2022, so please make sure you are running a newer 
version than that. Any bugs or
feature requests can be reported via the [issues
tab](https://github.com/JCSzamosi/aftersl1p/issues). I can make no guarantee
about how soon updates or fixes will happen, but I will do my best to fix 
critical bugs a quickly as possible.

To use this package I recommend cloning the repository using git. That will make
it easiest for you to stay up to date with new versions. If using git is not an
option for you, you can download a zip file of the code using the green button
at the top right corner of the page; however I recommend you check back at least
once every six months and download a new version if there have been updates.

## Installation

You can install the most stable version of AfterSl1p from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JCSzamosi/aftersl1p@*release")
```

You can also install the latest, development version with 

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JCSzamosi/aftersl1p@v0.0.1.9001")
```

N.B.: The value after the @ in the development version will change frequently,
so check back here (or check the Releases section of the repository) to make
sure you're getting the most recent version.

<!--
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(AfterSl1p)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
