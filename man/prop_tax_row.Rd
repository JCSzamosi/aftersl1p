prop_tax_row(taxrow)

\arguments{
\item{taxrow}{A single row in a taxon table}
}
\description{
\code{prop_tax_row} Takes the taxon assignment from the lowest assigned level
in an OTU's assignment and fills it in to all the lower, unresolved fields.
}
\section{Details}{

Often taxon cannot be assigned all the way down to genus from the limited
information available from a given variable region of 16S (or other marker
gene). If an OTU has been assigned to Order Enterobacteriales, but the Family
and genus cannot be resolved, then the Family and Genus fields are left
blank by QIIME. This function fills those fields with the string
'o_Enterobacteriales', so they are not parsed as NAs by ggplot and other
functions.
