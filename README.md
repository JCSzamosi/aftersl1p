Data Curation and Visualization for Microbiome Analyses
=======================================================

This is a draft R package that provides convenience functions for the
organization, curation, and visualization of microbiome data sets. This package
is lightly maintained by a single human and is provided as is, with no
guarantees of any kind.

Please see the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) for important updates and bug fixes,
and make sure you are using the most recent version of this package. Any bugs or
feature requests can be reported via the [issues
tab](https://github.com/JCSzamosi/aftersl1p/issues). I can make no guarantee
about how soon updates or fixes will happen, but I will do my best to fix 
critical bugs a quickly as possible.

To use this package I recommend cloning the repository using git. That will make
it easiest for you to stay up to date with new versions. If using git is not an
option for you, you can download a zip file of the code using the green button
at the top right corner of the page; however I recommend you check back at least
once every six months and download a new version if there have been updates.
